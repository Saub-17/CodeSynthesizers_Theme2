# Amazon Hackon Project: Enhanced Shopping Experience Using Visual AI (Theme 2)

Welcome to our hackathon project! We have developed a prototype that aims to enhance the shopping experience using visual AI technology. This project focuses on improving product search, recommendations, and item identification in text, image, or video content.

## Project Overview

In our project, we extended the X-ray feature from Amazon Prime Video to enable direct purchase of items featured in video content. By leveraging visual AI, we provide an improved shopping experience that makes it easier for users to find and purchase products.
